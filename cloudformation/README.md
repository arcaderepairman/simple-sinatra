These are modified copies of the AWS example template cloud formation scripts
you can find the originals here :

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/sample-templates-services-us-west-2.html

Please note these CF template will only work in the ap-southeast-2 region.  I haven't configure the AMI correctly for the other regions yet.
